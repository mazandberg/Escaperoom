                     "A single strand of DNA, say the left one, is made up of building blocks (nucleotides). "

                     "You will always find a T on the right where there is an A on the left, and a G on the right where there is a C on the left. "
                     "The double helix therefore consists of two strands containing complementary information: "

                     "Additionally, a so-called primer is required. A primer is a small piece of single-stranded DNA that initiates the reaction. "
                     "By carefully choosing a primer, scientists can copy exactly the piece of DNA they need. "
                     "Finally, an important enzyme is needed, which is called Taq polymerase. "
                     "This enzyme attaches the correct building blocks A, C, G or T one by one to the new strand until the entire piece of template DNA has been copied.")
